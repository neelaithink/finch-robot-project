# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of design choices

The robot displays a cool and innovative way of wishing a Happy Birthday to someone  through playing notes, showing a color, displaying letters, and finally doing a dance.

## Challenges faced and solutions
When we first started the project, we had orginally wanted to play another song but had difficulty playing the correct notes because the robot had different notes compared to the orginal song. We then switched it to happy birthday because its  a well known song and had simpler notes. 


## Future enhancements

If we were to have more time or continue working on this in the future, I think that my partner and I would focus on perfecting the notes to the happy birthday song. In addiition to that we might have liked to add another song or actually be able to play our original song. It would be cool if we were able to figure out how to dance and play the notes at the same time as well.
